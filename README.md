📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI)
1️⃣ Title

Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction | Power BI Dashboard

2️⃣ Executive Summary

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies, directly impacting revenue and growth.
This project analyzes historical customer data to identify churn patterns and predict high-risk customers. Interactive Power BI dashboards were built to help stakeholders understand churn drivers, customer behavior, and revenue impact, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

3️⃣ Business Problem

Telecom companies face increasing competition and customer attrition due to pricing, service quality, and contract flexibility.
The key business questions addressed in this project are:

Which customer segments are more likely to churn?

What factors (contract type, payment method, services, tenure) influence churn?

How does churn impact revenue?

Which customers are at high risk of churning in the future?

4️⃣ Methodology

Collected and cleaned telecom customer data

Performed data transformation and feature grouping (Age Group, Tenure Group, Charges Range)

Created calculated measures for churn rate, total churn, and revenue impact

Built interactive dashboards in Power BI:

Executive Summary for high-level insights

Prediction Dashboard to identify high-risk customers

Applied filters and slicers for dynamic analysis by state, contract type, internet service, and payment method
